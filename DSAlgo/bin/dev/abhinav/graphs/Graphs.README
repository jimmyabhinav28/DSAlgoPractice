topological sort is very similar to DFS. 

Types of Graphs:

Undirected unwieghted graphs
	Questions only on connectivity can come out of this kind of graphs
Undirected unweighted graphs
	Questions on connectivity, cost of connectivity etc. can come from these types of graphs
Directed un-weighted graphs
	Questions on graph connectivity, reachability of one node from another can come from these types of graphs
	Questions relating to cycles (detection, removal etc) can come from these kinds of graphs
Directed weighted graphs
	Connectivity, cost of connectivity, reachability, cycles can come from these graphs


Whatever can come for weighted graphs, can come for unweighted graphs, as they are just a special case of weighted graphs.


We will discuss the two types of traversal BFS and DFS for both adjancency matrix/ adjancency list and iterative/recursive ways

unless and until specifically specifically asked otherwise, we will use the adjancency list representation of the graph.
DFS, unless explicitly stated, should always be assumed to be implemented recursive only.
For BFS, recursive way does not make any sense (because we use a queue and not a stack, and a recursion only makes sense when a stack gets involved). Hence it has to be iterative only.
